        <h2>Jasprit Bumrah</h2>
        <div class="bio">
            Jasprit Jasbirsingh Bumrah (Punjabi: [dʒəsˈpɾiːt̪ bʊmˈɾaː]; born 6 December 1993) is an Indian international cricketer who plays for the Indian national cricket team in all formats of the game. He is the vice-captain of India in Test format. A right-arm fast bowler with a unique bowling action, Bumrah plays for Gujarat in domestic cricket and for Mumbai Indians in the Indian Premier League. Bumrah was a crucial member of the Indian team that won the 2024 T20 World Cup, where he was named the player of the tournament for his wicket taking in all phases while maintaining an economy of 4.17.

            Among Indian fast bowlers, he took 200 wickets in the fewest matches and reached 100 wickets in ODI cricket in the second-shortest time (in terms of matches played). He is the first bowler to have achieved the number one ranking in the ICC men's player rankings in all three formats of the game. He also holds the record of scoring the highest number of runs in an over in Test cricket. He achieved this feat against Stuart Broad.
            
            Bumrah made his domestic debut in 2012–13 Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy and also helped his side clinch its maiden title victory. His first-class debut came against Vidarbha, during the 2013–14 season of the Ranji Trophy. Bumrah was signed by the Mumbai Indians for the 2013 season of IPL. Since then, he has played for MI, contributing to the team's title wins five times. He is the second-highest wicket-taker for MI, behind Lasith Malinga, with 165 wickets in 133 matches.
            
            Bumrah made his international debut in January 2016 during India's tour of Australia, where he emerged as the highest wicket-taker of the T20 series. In 2016, he was the highest wicket-taker in a calendar year in T20I cricket, with 28 wickets. He made his Test debut in 2018 against South Africa. Since December 2023, he has served as the vice-captain of the Indian team in Test cricket and has also captained the team once in the absence of regular skipper Rohit Sharma. He was named in the ICC Men's Test Team of the Year in 2018 and the ICC Men's ODI Team of the Year in 2017 and 2018. Additionally, he was named in the ICC Men's T20I Team of the Decade for 2011–2020. Bumrah was awarded the Polly Umrigar Award by the BCCI twice, in 2018–19 and 2021–22. He was also named in the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 2022.
            
            Notably, Jasprit Bumrah achieved a milestone in 2024 by surpassing Ravichandran Ashwin's highest ICC Test bowling rating for an Indian bowler. Bumrah concluded the year as the leading wicket-taker in Test cricket, with 71 wickets, and reached a career-high rating of 907 points, placing him joint-17th on the all-time list alongside Derek Underwood. His performances, including a nine-wicket haul in the Melbourne Test in December 2024, secured his position as the top-ranked bowler in the ICC Men’s Test Rankings and earned him nominations for the Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy and ICC Men’s Test Cricketer of the Year.[4][5]
            
            Early life
            Jasprit Bumrah was born on 6 December 1993 into a Sikh Punjabi family in Ahmedabad, Gujarat.[6] His father, Jasbir Singh, ran a chemical business, while his mother, Daljeet Bumrah, worked as a school teacher. His father passed away when Bumrah was 5 years old due to hepatitis B.[7][8] His mother raised him and his sister Juhika in a middle-class environment in Ahmedabad. Bumrah attended Nirman High School in Vastrapur, Ahmedabad, where his mother worked as the vice principal. He also played cricket for Nirman's team.[9][10][11]
            
            Youth and domestic career
            In 2010, Bumrah appeared at the Gujarat Cricket Association's Under-19 district selection trials. The selectors did not include him in the main squad of 15 due to his unconventional bowling action but named him as a reserve. After the district team won the first three matches, all three reserve players were given a chance in the fourth three-day match. Bumrah took seven wickets in that match.[12]
            
            Bumrah made his twenty20 (T20) debut for Gujarat against Maharashtra in the 2012–13 Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, and helped his side clinch the title with his Man of the Match performance in the final, with figures of 3/14 to beat Punjab.[13] On 18 March 2013, during the match against Mumbai, former India coach John Wright, who was then the head coach of Mumbai Indians (MI) and scouting for the team at the time, was impressed by Bumrah's performance and invited him to sign up for MI.[11]
            
            Bumrah played first-class cricket for Gujarat and made his debut against Vidarbha in October 2013 during the 2013–14 season, where he took seven wickets for 89 runs.[14] During the 2015–16 Vijay Hazare Trophy, after the first two matches, the umpires called him for throwing and raised objections about his bowling action. The issue was resolved when the team management protested against it.[12] Gujarat won the trophy, with Bumrah taking a five-wicket haul in the final against Delhi.[15] On 11 December 2020, he scored his maiden first-class half century (55 not out) against Australia A during the India tour of Australia.[16]
